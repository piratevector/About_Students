My name is Andrew Alagna. I'm graduating from Hunter this semester, and starting with American Express as a fulltime SWE in August. I like to play ping-pong, handball and hackey sack.

I want to travel around the world. I think its good for your perspective and taste in food to experience different cultures as much as possible.
I used python to study DS&A and for a data science course. I'm looking forward to learning more Python.
